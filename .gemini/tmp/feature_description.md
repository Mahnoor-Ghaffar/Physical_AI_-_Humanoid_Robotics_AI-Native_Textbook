Objective: Generate a comprehensive, research-backed specification for Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook. This spec must enforce 3 chapters (per user directive), ensuring 100% alignment with /sp.constitution: technical accuracy (APA citations ≥50% official sources like developer.nvidia.com/isaac), executable code (Ubuntu 22.04 + ROS 2 Jazzy + Isaac Sim 2024.2+), consistent terminology, glossary integration, hardware track callouts, and chapter template compliance. Focus: Advanced perception, training, photorealistic sim, VSLAM, and bipedal navigation for humanoids. Research Phase (Mandatory Pre-Spec) - Conduct deep web searches/X searches for NVIDIA Isaac Sim 2024.2 (2025 updates), Isaac ROS 3.x VSLAM, Nav2 2.x bipedal extensions. - Prioritize official sources: docs.nvidia.com/isaac-sim (photorealism/synthetic data), developer.nvidia.com/isaac-ros (VSLAM/nav), ros.org nav2 docs. - Secondary: Peer-reviewed papers (arXiv: VSLAM for embodied AI), NVIDIA blogs (humanoid training), roboticsbackend.com (Isaac examples). - Validate 2025 updates: Omniverse Replicator 2.0 for data gen, GEMs for bipedal locomotion. - Extract: 10+ key diagrams (Mermaid for VSLAM pipelines), 5+ code snippets (OmniGraph nodes, ROS launch files), hardware specs (RTX 40-series/AGX Orin perf). - Output: Summarized research notes with APA citations (e.g., Tobin et al., 2017 for domain randomization; Huang et al., 2025 for Isaac ROS VSLAM). Module Structure Rules - Exactly 3 Chapters, each following 0003-chapter-template-system (11 sections: Objectives → References). - Progressive: Photorealistic sim → VSLAM/perception → Bipedal planning. - Total word count target: 9,000–12,000 across chapters. - Hardware Tracks: Callouts for Track A (RTX Workstation + Isaac Sim), B (Jetson/Unitree + Isaac ROS), C (Cloud/AWS Omniverse). - Glossary Additions: ≥25 terms (e.g., Omniverse, Replicator, VSLAM, GEM, Nav2). - Code: 3–5 executable examples/chapter (Python OmniScripts, ROS2 Nav2 configs), with sim-to-real warnings. - Assessments: 1 quiz/chapter (5–8 MCQ + 1 open), module capstone: Generate synthetic data for VSLAM-trained humanoid navigator. Chapter Breakdown (Fixed – Use Exactly These) 1. Chapter 1: Photorealistic Simulation with NVIDIA Isaac Sim (Focus: High-fidelity worlds, synthetic data generation). - Outcomes: Build Omniverse scenes; Use Replicator for datasets; Simulate humanoid dynamics. - Key: USD assets, OmniGraph, domain randomization. 2. Chapter 2: Isaac ROS for Hardware-Accelerated Perception (Focus: VSLAM and sensor fusion). - Outcomes: Deploy VSLAM pipelines; Fuse camera/IMU data; Optimize for edge hardware. - Key: GEMs extensions, CUDA-accelerated nodes, ROS2 integration. 3. Chapter 3: Nav2 Path Planning for Bipedal Humanoids (Focus: Locomotion and obstacle avoidance). - Outcomes: Configure Nav2 stacks; Implement bipedal planners; Tune for dynamic environments. - Key: Behavior trees, costmaps, humanoid-specific plugins. Deliverables (Output in Clean Markdown with Exact Sections) 1. Epic Summary (1 para: Module goals, progression, capstone tie-in). 2. Research Summary (Bullet notes + 15+ APA citations; include Mermaid VSLAM graph). 3. User Stories (12+ P0–P2: e.g., P0: Student generates synthetic dataset <10 min; P1: Runs VSLAM on Jetson). 4. Functional Requirements (FR-001+: Chapter outlines, code standards, diagram rules, quiz formats). 5. Detailed Chapter Specs (Per chapter: Outcomes, sections/word counts, 3+ code examples, 2 worked examples, math/equations). 6. Technical Design (MDX template adaptations, custom components e.g., IsaacSimScene, VslamPipeline). 7. Assessment Framework (Quizzes + capstone rubric: e.g., "Plan bipedal path using Nav2 in Isaac sim"). 8. Success Criteria (10+ measurable: 100% code runnable, ≥90% quiz pass rate simulation, Lighthouse ≥95). 9. Scope Boundaries (In: Isaac core/perception/planning only; Out: VLA integration – defer to Module 4). 10. Risks & Mitigation (Table: e.g., Risk: GPU req mismatches – Mitigate: Cloud fallback tests). 11. Next Actions (e.g., Generate Chapter 1 MDX via /sp.generate). This spec is binding for Module 3 implementation. Post-approval, use for iterative chapter generation (one-by-one via /sp.plan). Ensure zero plagiarism – all content original or cited.
