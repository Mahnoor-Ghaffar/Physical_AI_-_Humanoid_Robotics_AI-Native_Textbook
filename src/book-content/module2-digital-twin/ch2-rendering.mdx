# Chapter 2: Rendering in Digital Twins

## 1. Epic Overview
This chapter delves into the intricacies of rendering in digital twin environments, examining how visual fidelity and realistic appearances are achieved for humanoid robots. It covers topics such as materials, lighting, textures, and camera perspectives within simulation platforms like Gazebo and Unity, crucial for accurate visual feedback and human-robot interaction studies.

## 2. Phased Roadmap
- Phase 1: Research Validation & Docker Setup
- Phase 2: Chapter-by-Chapter Crafting (Ch1 → Ch3 sequential)
- Phase 3: Integration & Capstone
- Phase 4: Review, Testing & Polish

## 3. Architecture Sketch
- Docusaurus folder: `/docs/module2-digital-twin/` (ch2-rendering.mdx)
- Mermaid sidebar integration
- Custom components (e.g., UnitySceneSnippet)

## 4. Chapter Template Enforcement
- 11 sections mandatory
- Track callouts, glossary links, sim-to-real warnings

## 5. Formatting & Code Standards
- SDF/XML snippets (Gazebo Harmonic)
- Unity C# with ROS TCP Connector
- Mermaid sim pipelines
- Sensor msg examples (sensor_msgs)
- APA references block

## 6. Research Approach
- Official docs.ros.org/jazzy/gazebo & unity.com/robotics first
- Gazebo answers/unity forums for 2025 issues
- arXiv sim-to-real papers
- Concurrent validation while writing

## 7. Key Decisions
- Base on Gazebo Harmonic + Unity 2023 LTS
- Humanoid examples: Generic + Unitree H1 SDF/URDF
- Full launchable worlds/scripts
- Interlinking to Module 1 (URDF import) & Module 3 (perception)

## 8. Testing & Validation
- Docusaurus build
- Code execution (Docker: Ubuntu 22.04 + Jazzy + Gazebo Harmonic + Unity Hub)
- Accuracy vs official docs
- Objectives coverage checklist
- APA lint
- Playwright section visibility & diagram rendering

## 9. Version Strategy
- Pin Harmonic/Unity 2023 LTS; note migration paths
- Changelog for tool updates
