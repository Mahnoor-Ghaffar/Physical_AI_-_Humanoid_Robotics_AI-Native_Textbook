# Chapter 1: Physics in Digital Twins

## 1. Epic Overview
This chapter explores the fundamental principles of physics simulation within digital twins, focusing on how real-world physical behaviors are replicated in virtual environments like Gazebo and Unity. It covers topics such as rigid body dynamics, collision detection, and material properties, essential for creating accurate and interactive humanoid robot simulations.

## 2. Phased Roadmap
- Phase 1: Research Validation & Docker Setup
- Phase 2: Chapter-by-Chapter Crafting (Ch1 → Ch3 sequential)
- Phase 3: Integration & Capstone
- Phase 4: Review, Testing & Polish

## 3. Architecture Sketch
- Docusaurus folder: `/docs/module2-digital-twin/` (ch1-physics.mdx)
- Mermaid sidebar integration
- Custom components (e.g., GazeboWorldDiagram)

## 4. Chapter Template Enforcement
- 11 sections mandatory
- Track callouts, glossary links, sim-to-real warnings

## 5. Formatting & Code Standards
- SDF/XML snippets (Gazebo Harmonic)
- Unity C# with ROS TCP Connector
- Mermaid sim pipelines
- Sensor msg examples (sensor_msgs)
- APA references block

## 6. Research Approach
- Official docs.ros.org/jazzy/gazebo & unity.com/robotics first
- Gazebo answers/unity forums for 2025 issues
- arXiv sim-to-real papers
- Concurrent validation while writing

## 7. Key Decisions
- Base on Gazebo Harmonic + Unity 2023 LTS
- Humanoid examples: Generic + Unitree H1 SDF/URDF
- Full launchable worlds/scripts
- Interlinking to Module 1 (URDF import) & Module 3 (perception)

## 8. Testing & Validation
- Docusaurus build
- Code execution (Docker: Ubuntu 22.04 + Jazzy + Gazebo Harmonic + Unity Hub)
- Accuracy vs official docs
- Objectives coverage checklist
- APA lint
- Playwright section visibility & diagram rendering

## 9. Version Strategy
- Pin Harmonic/Unity 2023 LTS; note migration paths
- Changelog for tool updates
